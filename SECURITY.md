# Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security issues you discovered in the Donk'LAN to donkesport@gmail.com.

We will assess the risk, plus make a fix available before we create a GitHub issue.

If the security issue you discovered is in a dependency we are using, please refer to its own security policy.

Thank you for your contribution.
